                This pastebin was built using <a href="http://wicket.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache Wicket</a>.  The original code was
                built by several folks as a tutorial for learning Wicket named <a href="http://www.mysticcoders.com/blog/2009/03/09/5-days-of-wicket/" target="_blank">5 Days of Wicket</a>.  There's a link in the
                navigation to the <a href="http://github.com/kinabalu/mysticpaste/">source code</a> which you can peruse at your leisure.
            </p>
            <p>
                The idea of a pastebin is simple, copy all or a fragment of code you need help with into the content box on the page.
                Select which language the code is in for nice syntax highlighting provided by the <a href="http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/" target="_blank">SyntaxHighlighter</a>
                JavaScript library.  You will receive a small URL to paste into an email, IRC, mailing list, or instant message to receive help
                on your issue.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you'd like to upload an image with your paste, you can drag any image to the New Paste window and it will upload to imgur and attach to the paste.
            </p>
            <p>
                We have plugins for 5 different development environments so you can paste directly from the editor.

                    To highlight certain lines in a text, append the line numbers separated by commas (will also accept ranges) like so:

                        <li>/view/1/1-3</li>
